Watson approached this male, put a .38-caliber pistol to his head, and robbed him of his cash. Meanwhile, Cotton saw the Assistant District Attorney outside the center and demanded money from him after pulling a 380 semi-automatic pistol. The victim told Cotton he had no money but that he had valuables in his car. As Cotton put him in the back seat of his Mustang, the other robbery victim, who had gone driving around to the front of the community center to call police, again drove into the parking lot and began blowing his car horn and blinking his lights in an effort to ward off the robbers. Cotton reportedly ordered Watson to shoot the man in the car blowing his horn and then fired two shots into the Assistant District Attorney",Lawrence Edward Watson
