Held in the Harris County Jail and released from the jail on 4/4/92 under paroled in absentia provisions. TDCJ , received 11/24/93, Harris County, 6 years, attempted murder, released under mandatory supervision to Harris Co. on 2/26/96","Convicted in the September 1996 shooting death of a white male Fort Bend County Assistant District Attorney outside the Jewish Community Center in Houston. Cotton and accomplice Lawrence Watson, both armed with pistols, were riding bicycles through the community center parking lot when Watson spotted another male exiting his vehicle. Watson approached this male, put a .38-caliber pistol to his head, and robbed him of his cash. Meanwhile, Cotton saw the Assistant District Attorney outside the center and demanded money from him after pulling a 380 semi-automatic pistol. The victim told Cotton he had no money but that he had valuables in his car. As Cotton put him in the back seat of his Mustang, the other robbery victim, who had gone driving around to the front of the community center to call police, again drove into the parking lot and began blowing his car horn and blinking his lights in an effort to ward off the robbers. Cotton reportedly ordered Watson to shoot the man in the car blowing his horn and then fired two shots into the Assistant District Attorney's head. As the robbers attempted to flee on their bicycles, the man in the other vehicle gave chase in his car and struck Cotton, who with Watson managed to escape on foot by jumping a fence. Following his arrest, Watson implicated Cotton, telling police that Cotton killed the Assistant District Attorney because he had seen the gold badge the victim carried with him as a member of the district attorneys office. The badge was found lying at the victims feet inside the car. Witnesses also told police that Cotton later bragged about shooting the law after seeing the badge."

News Online Services Inside TDCJ Information for Victims Career Opportunities Inmate Information Find a Facility Death Row Information Inmate Information Name Hughes,09/17/1976,12,04/04/1976,"Farmer, Laborer",None,"On the evening of April 4, 1976, Billy George Hughes checked into the Days Inn Motel in Brookshire , Texas, using a stolen credit card. When the clerk confronted Hughes in his room about the stolen card, she noticed a gun on his bed. The clerk then left Hughes's room to notify the motel security guard of the problem. After the clerk left his room, Hughes got into his car and sped away on Interstate 10 heading west. Texas Department of Public Safety Troopers Jack Reichert and Mark Frederick pulled over the 1975 Ford LTD Hughes was driving on Interstate 10 near Sealy, Texas; they were responding to a dispatcher's report that a man driving a similar car had attempted to use a stolen credit card at a nearby motel. The troopers followed Hughes's car on Interstate 10 until it exited the highway. At this point, Trooper Frederick, who was driving, turned on the overhead lights, and Hughes pulled over to the shoulder of the exit ramp. Trooper Frederick exited the police car and walked up to the driver's side door of Hughes's car. Trooper Reichert got out of the patrol car almost immediately after Frederick did. Approaching the Ford behind Frederick, Reichert heard a muffled shot and observed Frederick grunt and lurch to the side. Hughes immediately sped away from the scene as Trooper Reichert fired six times at the fleeing vehicle. Trooper Reichert then called for assistance and tended to Trooper Frederick; however, Reichert could find no pulse. Trooper Mark Frederick was later declared dead in the ambulance en route to the Sealy Medical Center. Upon hearing of the shooting, DPS Troopers Randall Baisch and Rodney Green were proceeding toward the scene when they discovered Hughes's abandoned car approximately three miles from the scene of the shooting. The troopers observed that the car had been struck by several bullets, and inside the car was a holster and a room key from the Days Inn Motel in Brookshire. Soon thereafter, a massive manhunt began for Hughes, involving as many as five hundred law enforcement officers. Approximately two-and-a-half days after the shooting, Texas Ranger Ray Scholton, who was in charge of the investigation, received a report that a possible suspect had been sighted six miles south of Sealy. Ranger Scholton went to the location by helicopter, where he spotted Hughes hiding under a mesquite tree in a pasture. As the helicopter hovered a few feet above the ground, Hughes pointed a gun at the helicopter. As soon as Ranger Scholton pointed his gun out the helicopter at Hughes, Hughes dropped his weapon and was taken into custody. A check of Hughes's car revealed that it had been reported stolen. A search of the car revealed the following items: one holster for an automatic handgun on the front seat, one holster for a revolver in the glove compartment, and the following items in the trunk of the car: a fully loaded .30 caliber carbine; a loaded, sawed-off short barrel twelve-gauge shotgun; a .300 Magnum rifle; extra .38 caliber shotgun ammunition; and a Halloween mask. Additionally, Hughes had a 9 millimeter handgun loaded with thirteen or fourteen rounds on him when he was captured."
