Summary of Incident Brewer was convicted in the murder of a black male occurring on 06/07/98. The offense involved Brewer and two co-defendants torturing and killing a 49-year old handicapped black male during the nighttime hours, in rural Jasper County, Texas. The victim was observed in the back of a pickup truck occupied by Brewer and his co-defendants. This was the last occasion the victim was seen alive by persons  other than Brewer and his co-defendants. Brewer and his co-defendants drove to  an isolated spot on a logging road where they beat and tormented the victim, then tied him to a logging chain, which was hooked to the pickup truck. Brewer and his co-defendants then dragged the victim to his death, leaving his decapitated and dismembered body to be found the following day by citizens and law enforcement officials. It was argued in court that Brewer and his  co-defendants engaged in this criminal act, in part, due to their racially separatist affiliation with the Confederate Knights of America and the Ku Klux Klan. Brewer and one co-defendant were documented members of the Confederate  Knights of America and a large number of Ku Klux Klan and other racial separatist organization paraphernalia was discovered in a residence occupied by the three.

TDCJ #651521, received  11/24/93, Harris County, 6 years, attempted murder,  released under mandatory supervision to Harris Co. on 2/26/96 Summary of Incident Convicted  in the September 1996 shooting death of a white male Fort Bend County  Assistant District Attorney outside the Jewish Community Center in Houston. Cotton and  accomplice Lawrence Watson, both armed with pistols, were riding bicycles  through the community center parking lot when Watson spotted another male  exiting his vehicle. Watson approached this male, put a .38-caliber pistol to  his head, and robbed him of his cash. Meanwhile, Cotton saw the Assistant  District Attorney outside the center and demanded money from him after pulling  a 380 semi-automatic pistol. The victim told Cotton he had no money but that he  had valuables in his car. As Cotton put him in the back seat of his Mustang,  the other robbery victim, who had gone driving around to the front of the  community center to call police, again drove into the parking lot and began  blowing his car horn and blinking his lights in an effort to ward off the  robbers. Cotton reportedly ordered Watson to shoot the man in the car blowing  his horn and then fired two shots into the Assistant District Attorney's head.  As the robbers attempted to flee on their bicycles, the man in the other  vehicle gave chase in his car and struck Cotton, who with Watson managed to  escape on foot by jumping a fence. Following his arrest, Watson implicated  Cotton, telling police that Cotton killed the Assistant District Attorney  because he had seen the gold badge the victim carried with him as a member of  the district attorney’s office. The badge was found lying at the victim’s feet  inside the car. Witnesses also told police that Cotton later bragged about  “shooting the law” after seeing the badge.

When the clerk confronted Hughes in his room about the stolen  card, she noticed a gun on his bed. The clerk then left Hughes's room to notify  the motel security guard of the problem. After the clerk left his room, Hughes  got into his car and sped away on Interstate 10 heading west. Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS)Troopers  Jack Reichert and Mark Frederick pulled over the 1975 Ford LTD Hughes was  driving on Interstate 10 near Sealy, Texas; they were responding to a  dispatcher's report that a man driving a similar car had attempted to use a  stolen credit card at a nearby motel. The troopers followed Hughes's car on  Interstate 10 until it exited the highway. At this point, Trooper Frederick,  who was driving, turned on the overhead lights, and Hughes pulled over to the  shoulder of the exit ramp. Trooper Frederick  exited the police car and walked up to the driver's side door of Hughes's car.  Trooper Reichert got out of the patrol car almost immediately after Frederick did. Approaching  the Ford behind Frederick, Reichert heard a  muffled shot and observed Frederick  grunt and lurch to the side. Hughes immediately sped away from the scene as  Trooper Reichert fired six times at the fleeing vehicle. Trooper Reichert then  called for assistance and tended to Trooper Frederick; however, Reichert could  find no pulse. Trooper Mark Frederick was later declared dead in the ambulance  en route to the Sealy   Medical Center. Upon hearing of the shooting, DPS Troopers  Randall Baisch and Rodney Green were proceeding toward the scene when they  discovered Hughes's abandoned car approximately three miles from the scene of  the shooting. The troopers observed that the car had been struck by several bullets,  and inside the car was a holster and a room key from the Days Inn Motel in  Brookshire. Soon  thereafter, a massive manhunt began for Hughes, involving as many as five  hundred law enforcement officers. Approximately two-and-a-half days after the  shooting, Texas Ranger Ray Scholton, who was in charge of the investigation,  received a report that a possible suspect had been sighted six miles south of  Sealy. Ranger Scholton went to the location by helicopter, where he spotted  Hughes hiding under a mesquite tree in a pasture. As the helicopter hovered a  few feet above the ground, Hughes pointed a gun at the helicopter. As soon as  Ranger Scholton pointed his gun out the helicopter at Hughes, Hughes dropped  his weapon and was taken into custody. A check of Hughes's car revealed that it had  been reported stolen. A search of the car revealed the following items: one  holster for an automatic handgun on the front seat, one holster for a revolver  in the glove compartment, and the following items in the trunk of the car: a  fully loaded .30 caliber carbine; a loaded, sawed-off short barrel twelve-gauge  shotgun; a .300 Magnum rifle; extra .38 caliber shotgun ammunition; and a  Halloween mask. Additionally, Hughes had a 9 millimeter handgun loaded with  thirteen or fourteen rounds on him when he was captured. Co-Defendants None.
